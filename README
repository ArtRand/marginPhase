This is a simple demo program for doing genotyping, methylation calling and haplotyping.

The project should be located in the same directory containing sonLib (https://github.com/benedictpaten/sonLib), which must be installed.
Given this requirement a simple 'make all' should be enough to build the project. 'make test' will then do a batch of obligatory tests.
